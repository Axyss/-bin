# !bin - Keeping things simple! &nbsp; (v1.1)

If you're an experienced osu! player you've probably already noticed that beatmap videos are too distracting 
and you have ended up disabling them. 
But... what about removing that videos and free some space?

!bin aims to be an __easy tool to get rid of all the beatmap videos__, forget those hard to understand batch (.bat) scripts, !bin implements a __very simple GUI__ and an __automatic beatmap video detecting algorithm__ so you resume your circle clicking activities faster.
