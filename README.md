If you're an experienced osu! player you've probably already noticed that beatmap videos are too distracting so you have ended up disabling them. 
But... what about removing that videos and free some space?

<b>!bin</b> aims to be an __easy tool to get rid of all the beatmap videos__, forget those hard to understand batch (.bat) scripts, !bin implements a __very simple GUI__ and an __automatic beatmap video detection algorithm__ so you resume your circle-clicking activities faster.
